# 一致性哈希

[一致性哈希的简单认识](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1735480432495470467&wfr=spider&for=pc)

由于有虚拟节点，哈希环上的相邻点可能来自于任意某个节点，因此增删节点影响的是随机节点，能避免雪崩。


# 最终一致性

Eventual Consistency (EC) in distributed systems refers to the situation where the state may not be the same across replicas of the system but, given enough time and perhaps after network partitions, downtime and other eventualities have been resolved, the system design will ensure that the state becomes the same everywhere.

The main weakness of the eventual consistency definition is that it offers no guarantees as to when the shared state will converge or how much the individual states will be allowed to diverge until then5. Strong eventual consistency (SEC) addresses these issues by establishing an additional safety guarantee: if two replicas have received the same updates, their state will be the same.
